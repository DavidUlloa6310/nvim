#   David's Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, designed for efficient and streamlined development. It leverages various plugins to enhance functionality, including LSP support, autocompletion, file management, and more.

##   Repository Structure

The core of the configuration is organized as follows:

* `init.lua`: This is the main entry point for the Neovim configuration, responsible for loading the rest of the modules.
* `after/plugin/`: This directory contains configuration files for specific plugins, which are loaded after the main plugins.
    * `fugitive.lua`: Configuration for the `vim-fugitive` plugin, providing Git integration.
    * `harpoon.lua`:  Configuration for `harpoon`, a tool for marking and quickly navigating between files.
    * `lsp.lua`:  Configuration for LSP (Language Server Protocol) support, including `lsp-zero`, `mason.nvim`, and `nvim-lspconfig`.
    * `telescope.lua`: Configuration for `telescope.nvim`, a fuzzy finder.
    * `treesitter.lua`: Configuration for `nvim-treesitter`, providing enhanced syntax highlighting and code navigation.
    * `undotree.lua`: Configuration for `undotree`, a plugin for visualizing the undo history.
* `lua/davidulloa/`: This directory contains custom Lua modules.
    * `init.lua`:  Initializes the `davidulloa` module and loads other modules within it.
    * `packer.lua`: Configuration for `packer.nvim`, the Neovim package manager.
    * `remap.lua`: Defines custom keybindings.
    * `set.lua`:  Sets various Neovim options.
* `plugin/packer_compiled.lua`: This file is automatically generated by `packer.nvim` and contains the plugin loader code.

##   Keybindings

Here's a breakdown of the keybindings used in this configuration:

###   General

* `<C-j>`: Navigate to file 2 in the harpoon list.
* `<C-k>`: Navigate to file 3 in the harpoon list.
* `<C-l>`: Navigate to file 4 in the harpoon list.

###   LSP (Language Server Protocol)

* `gh`:  `Lspsaga lsp_finder` (finds LSP related information).
* `gp`:  `Lspsaga peek_definition` (peek definition of a symbol).
* `K`:   `Lspsaga hover_doc` (show hover documentation).

* `<C-p>`:    Find Git files.
* `<leader>ps`: Grep string (find string in files).

###   Undotree

* `<leader>u`: Toggle the Undotree window.

##   Plugin Management

* `packer.nvim` is used for plugin management. See `lua/davidulloa/packer.lua` for the plugin list and configuration.
* To install plugins, use Packer's commands (e.g., `:PackerSync`).

##   LSP Configuration

* `lsp-zero` is used to simplify LSP configuration.
* `mason.nvim` and `mason-lspconfig.nvim` are used to manage and install LSP servers.
* See `after/plugin/lsp.lua` for LSP server setup and keybindings.

##   Treesitter

* `nvim-treesitter` is used for improved syntax highlighting and code navigation.
* See `after/plugin/treesitter.lua` for configuration.

##   Custom Settings

* Various Neovim options are set in `lua/davidulloa/set.lua`, including:
    * Line numbering.
    * Tab settings.
    * Indentation.
    * Search behavior.
    * UI settings (e.g., color column, termguicolors).
    * Markdown wrapping.

##   Color Scheme

* [rose-pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim) is the color scheme.
* It is configured in `lua/davidulloa/packer.lua`.
